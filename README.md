# Portfolio Site
This is still a work in process.

This site uses the npm module `gh-pages` to build and process the files located in the `dist` directory. It also makes use of `three.js` in order to create some graphical experiences that I am still working on. In the meantime, the `index.html` page is where most of the content is going to be hosted from and processed at.

This file (`README.md`) will improve with time as the site becomes more clear as to what I want to incorperate into it and showcase.
