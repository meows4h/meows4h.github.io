# Portfolio Site
This is still a work in process.

This site uses the npm module `gh-pages` to build and process the files located in the `dist` directory. It also makes use of `three.js` in order to create some graphical experiences that I am still working on. In the meantime, the `index.html` page is where most of the content is going to be hosted from and processed at.

This file (`README.md`) will improve with time as the site becomes more clear as to what I want to incorperate into it and showcase.

## Layout
Within the `dist` directory, there are a couple of files:
- `css` contains any .css files that need to be loaded
- `images` contains any image assets
- `js` contains all the JavaScript scripts that run parts of the site
- `pages` contains all the additional pages beyond the `index.html` content
- `index.html` is the home page content that gets served

## Extras
- `meows4h.github.io/pages/ascii.html` shows off a 3D playspace with a moveable camera, controls, collision checking, as well as rendering the output to ASCII characters
